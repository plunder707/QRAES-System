# Quantum-Resistant Adaptive Encryption System (QRAES)

## Overview
The Quantum-Resistant Adaptive Encryption System (QRAES) is a cutting-edge security solution that integrates advanced encryption methods, AI-driven threat analysis, and blockchain technology. This system offers robust, adaptive, and future-proof encryption by dynamically switching between AES and RSA encryption based on real-time threat assessments. It employs memory-hard functions and NTRU hashing to ensure quantum resistance and uses the Sawtooth blockchain for secure key management. Multi-factor and FIDO2 authentication further enhance security.

## Features
- **AES and RSA Encryption:** Fast, secure encryption methods suitable for various data protection needs.
- **Adaptive Encryption Switching:** AI-powered dynamic switching between AES and RSA based on real-time threat analysis.
- **Memory-Hard Functions:** Increased resistance to brute-force attacks through resource-intensive cryptographic functions.
- **NTRU Hashing:** Quantum-resistant hashing to protect against future quantum computing threats.
- **Blockchain Key Management:** Secure, transparent key management using the Sawtooth blockchain.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and FIDO2:** Strong authentication mechanisms to ensure authorized access.
